PA9  USART1_TX
PA10 USART1_RX

This is an example bootloader.  Normally I wouldnt write/use a
bootloader on a chip like this.  But this ebay board doesnt have a
boot0 button like the boards I make it has a jumper, more time consuming
so I made this bootloader.

This reads motorola srecord files.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_(file_format)

It is an ASCII file format that contains the binary or program we
want to load and run.  An example line is

S3152000002029000348FFF7EFFF70BDC0461C3801408A

I am using the S3 records, in fact this code may require it.  The
line starts with an S, and then the next number tells what kind of
record this line is, 3, meaning data with a 32 bit address.  The
next two numbers tell how many bytes are in this record, then because
this is an S3 the next 8 numbers are the 32 bit address 0x20000020
in this case.  Then the data starts byte 0x29 is at address 0x20000020
byte 0x00 at address 0x20000021 and so on.  The last byte is a checksum
to insure the line/record was read right.

So using a dumb terminal connected to the uart (with this nucleo board
there is a virtual uart through the usb)  It boots and shows

12345678

SREC

Then if you cut and paste the .srec contents (open them in a text
editor and cut and paste) into the dumb terminal then it will parse the
srecords and write ram with those values.

If it sees an S7 record

S70520000000DA

Which in this case says the entry point is 0x20000000 then it will print
that out

12345678

SREC
20000000

In either case once you have downloaded the program using the srecord
format, then enter 'g' and it will run the program (after printing
the entry point it is using).  So if you build and run the testsrec
program in this directory you will see

12345678

SREC
20000000
20000000
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567
01234567

The test program knowing/assming the uart was configured by the
bootloader doesnt have to re-init the uart, just shove bytes out.
Also note that with the cortex-m the way it boots is with a vector
table, but sram based programs like this, this bootloader simply
branches to the entry point (I guess I could have made it read a
vector table and branch there...but didnt...a feature you can
add yourself if you want).

This board has 4096 of ram so the programs are limited to that
minus a little for the stack used by this program.  So the programs
have to be pretty small.

#define SRAMSTART 0x20000000
//leave room for the stack used by this program.
#define SRAMEND   (0x20000FFF-64)
