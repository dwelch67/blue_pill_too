See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

See the led77.pdf and kicad pcb files.  This is NOT a charlieplexed
board, there are three ground pins and four source pins.  To light
an led a source needs to be high and a ground low.

using the square as pin 1 I have PA1 through PA7 connected to pin 1
through 7 in that order.  1,2,3,4 control the columns (source),
5,6,7 control the rows (sink).

This example simply blinks them all on and all off to see them all
working.
