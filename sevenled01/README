See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

See the led77.pdf and kicad pcb files.  This is NOT a charlieplexed
board, there are three ground pins and four source pins.  To light
an led a source needs to be high and a ground low.  To keep the others
off reverse that.  When a row is grounded the others will stay off
as you have them grounded too only the one or ones you have high will
be on.

using the square as pin 1 I have PA1 through PA7 connected to pin 1
through 7 in that order.  1,2,3,4 control the columns (source),
5,6,7 control the rows (sink).

I cranked the clock up to 48MHz so that I could get a tiny little
blink on the background leds.

This is working its way to being a pseudo binary clock.  The top
row is hours 1 to 12 in binary.  Second row is tens of minutes, third
ones of minutes, both of these binary or BCD whatever you want to
think of it as.  They go from 0-6 and 0-9

This also uses interrupts, I have done a clock like this without
interrupts, wanted to build the next one with interrupts, will see
how this turns out.  The foreground will get the time from a time
source (GPS receiver) the interrupt will blink the leds based on the
current time.  This directory represents the background blinking
the leds to show the time.

If you go to oshpark.com and use the led77.kicad_pcb file you can create
your own pcb.  Getting the parts and learning to solder is up to you.

I dont want mine very bright want not to light the room in the dark,
I use the lowest mcd leds I can find.  Well close to I use a 2 or
2.5 mcd led, I think mouser has some 1 mcd leds.
